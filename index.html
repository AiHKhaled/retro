<h1>About this website </h1>

    <p class="intro">
      Many web users nowadays looks back on the days of Web 1.0 and cringe at the likes of Geocities and Angelfire. But there is something in those old platforms and the websites that they contained that seems to be absent from the modern web. 
      <br>
      the old web focused more on individuals and individuality, whereas the new web is less individual and much more commercial. <br>
      the Web 1.0 style allows much more space for someone to make their online presence exactly how they want it.
      so this is an ode to what was once the internet, how sites were in the
      first days. 
      I felt nostalgic for those days, so I made one that
      resembles them, a question of keeping the torch burning, and I hope the
      sentiment will get through to those who visit.
